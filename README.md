# TransformerX

TransformerX is a project aimed at gaining a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics of the original Transformer architecture. This implementation serves as both an educational tool and a functional model for various NLP tasks, allowing for a hands-on approach to learning and experimenting with Transformer-based models.

## Overview

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. TransformerX is a faithful implementation of this architecture, focusing on clarity and simplicity to aid learning and experimentation.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Implementation**: Covers all essential components of the Transformer architecture, including positional encoding, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and residual connections.
- **Educational Focus**: Written with clear, concise code and detailed comments to facilitate understanding of each part of the model.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable and modifiable, allowing for experimentation with different configurations and enhancements.

## Credits

This project was heavily inspired by the following resources:

- [PyTorch Transformer Implementation](https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer): A fantastic resource that provided a solid foundation for this implementation.
- [YouTube Explanation by Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCz4OMemCcA&t=1212s&ab_channel=UmarJamil): The best explanation of the Transformer architecture available online. Highly recommended for anyone looking to understand the intricacies of the model.
